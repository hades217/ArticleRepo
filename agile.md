### Git branching model

This repo branching model is inspired by Git Flow. Currently we have these types of branches:

* master - Latest release, stable
* develop - Main development, unstable
* release/ - Release archive
* feature/ - Specific features development
* example/ - Helpful examples
* hotfix/ - Emergency fixes for latest release

Read the Git [Flow reference](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). This repo uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)
