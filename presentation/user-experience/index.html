							Some UX issues you may not have considered
						</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>
							The Save Button and the Generation Gap
						</h2>

						<p>
							Research has shown there is a generation gap with saving files:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">
								Older generations expect there to be a delay and an animation to show content is saving
							</li>
							
							<li class="fragment">
								Where as the millennial generation just expect it always save, that it is always in the cloud
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>
							The Save Button
						</h2>

						<p class="fragment">
							In some instances, online software will show a saving message for a prolonged period of time so 
							the user is comfortable that their file was saved.
						</p>

						<!--
							For example, online software for solicitors and lawyers, dealing with highly sensitive data and 
							work that takes hours to perform, it was a common problem for the uses to feel unsure whether 
							their work was saved. To reduce the stress or uncertainty, the company introduced three dots 
							that would animate after a save was triggered.
						-->

						<p class="fragment">
							This small fake animation made users more comfortable that their work had been saved.

				<section>
					<h2>
						Sometimes existing patterns don't make sense
					</h2>

					<p class="fragment">
						Like the save icon, a fair significant of younger uses have never experienced or seen a real 
						floppy disk.
					</p>

					<p class="fragment">
						Some Generation Z children were shown a floppy disk and assumed it was a 3D printed version of the 
						save icon.
					</p>

					<p class="fragment">
						Many designers have tried to create a new save icon but have failed due to popularity of the 
						current icon.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>
						Differences of user experience between generations
					</h2>

					<p class="fragment">
						Millennials will generally expect things to flow and work without having to read labels, and help text.
					</p>

					<p class="fragment">
						Previous generations will take care to read the copy and ensure that they have all the 
						instructions they need before they commence with the form.
					</p>
					
					<p class="fragment">
						Great tangible example of this behaviour is with electronic devices, Blu Ray Player, Playstation etc

						<h2>
							User Experience effects with design
						</h2>

						<p class="fragment">
							The design of a product or service, whether it is funky or professional can have an impact on the 
							user's experience.
						</p>

						<p class="fragment">
							A food outlet can have a funky website, and reflect the company's culture.
						</p>
						
						<p class="fragment">
							Whereas, a product / service like a bank needs to be professionally designed, clean and easy to use.
